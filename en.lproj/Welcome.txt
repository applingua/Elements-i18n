Hi

Thank you for downloading Elements 2!  

Elements is a Markdown and Dropbox powered text editor from Second Gear.  Elements allows you to view, edit and share plain text documents on your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch.  All of your data is stored on your personal Dropbox account.  

## Where do files go?

When you first log in, Elements creates a new folder called "Elements" in your Dropbox.  In the Elements folder should be a single file called "Welcome.txt".  That's the file you are reading right now!  

Any time you edit one of the text files in 'Elements' or on your Mac or PC, the changes will be pushed back to Dropbox and propogated back down.  Note: Dropbox isn't a true syncing platform, so you can't have multiple people working on the same file at different places at once. If, however, you're someone who writes a bit on your Mac and then packs the iPad for a trip to the coffee shop to continue, Elements is a perfect fit.

## Features

Elements includes just enough to support your writing without getting in your way:

* Create and edit files.
* Preview your work using Markdown.
* Publishing your work to a variety of services like Tumblr, Facebook and Evernote.
* Exporting to multiple file formats such as PDF and HTML.
* Autosaving.
* Word, character and line counts.
* A scratchpad for you to jot down notes and ideas as you're writing.  
* TextExpander touch support.  
* Email your files as attachments.  
* Email the contents of your files as HTML.
